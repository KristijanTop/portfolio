      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Krstijan TopiÄ‡. I come from a small town in the beautiful
        land of Croatia. I have a passion for technology, especially web
        development and UI/UX development. I love to express myself in creative
        ways, to implement my ideas and to solve problems as they come by. The
        feeling when my code works is the feeling that I love to chase.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I'm in the final year of my graduate study of IT Management
        with only a graduate project left. For the past several months, I have
        been intensely focused on learning web development, especially Vue JS,
        and it has become very clear to me that that is the thing that I want to
        do in my career.
